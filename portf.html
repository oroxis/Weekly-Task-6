              <p> Unfortunately many think, selling a property is anybody’s game, but in reality, the risk and responsibility involved in selling a property is same that of purchasing a property.
              It is very critical to take a decision to sell a property, as selling an immovable asset may be easy and to replace the same, it is very difficult. This is due to the fact that property prices increase astronomically over the years, much beyond anybody’s incremental income during the same period. Hence it is advisable to take decision to sell a property, only under dire need and there no other options are available.
              Our trained Counselor will weigh all critical factors before suggesting to sell your property and will provide general guidelines on updating of property documents required for sale, the role of broker, doing due diligence on purchaser, seeking professional help in smooth transaction of sale and the post sale compliances.

                <p style="font-family: 'Cuprum', sans-serif;"> Once decision is taken to sell a property, the most important thing is to fix a selling price, with room for slight negotiations on price. It is essential to appoint a well versed Valuer (Licensed Chartered Engineer) to fix the market value. The Valuer surveys the locality and neighbourhood, collects required information, measurements, construction details, fixed fittings and furniture, amenities provided, normal wear and tear and apply depreciation values to arrive at saleable value of the property. Without taking advice from Valuer, it is likely that either seller quotes throw-away price and loses huge amounts or by quoting higher price, sale will not happen.
                Once decided to sell, the first job is to compile property documents that are necessary for sale, such as ownership documents (sale deed/gift deed etc.), prior title deeds, title verification report and collect latest property tax paid receipt, Khata extract, Khata Certificate and latest Encumbrance Certificate etc. along with loan closure/outstanding details, if loan is availed.
                If site is recently purchased from Developer/Owner, bifurcation/change of Khata process needs to be completed to have Khata endorsement, Certificate and the Khata extract.
                If a built property is to be sold, copy of the plan approved by BBMP (or competent authority) is also required.
                If loan is availed to purchase the property and is still outstanding, seller is required to obtain NOC from the Bank/HFC to sell the property. If an apartment getting sold, referring to bye-laws of apartment owner’s association, the seller may have to obtain permission to sell.

               <p> Due to poor image of broker (Real Estate Agent), majority wish to avoid the broker community and directly deal with the purchaser. But most of the time, especially in resale options, the seller is compelled to deal through a broker, under the market practice and hence it becomes necessary to do due diligence on the broker and deal with him only if he is found genuine. And right from the initial discussion on the sale of the property, it is essential to involve the intended purchaser.
                Since selling price will run in to lakhs and crores of Rupees, the seller needs to do a lot of home work in thoroughly verifying the genuine intention of buyer. He should check the background of intended purchaser, his standing in the society, his financial status and also the repayment capacity, if the purchaser is planning avail a home loan/commercial to purchase the property.
                On assigning the job of carrying due diligence on the broker and the purchaser, we will personally have one to one meeting with both of them and collect required information. We will thoroughly verify the background of the broker and purchaser, role of broker, arrangement of funds to purchase the property and loan eligibility and other related issues. If required, we will arrange the home loan to the purchaser.
